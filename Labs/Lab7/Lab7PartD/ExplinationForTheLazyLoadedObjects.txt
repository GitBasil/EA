When we use eager loading the data get pulled from the database immediately, but this could get very expensive when dealing with large data.
The solution fot this is to use Lazy loading, but with lazy loading you need to have the persistent context opened in order to get the data from the database. 
This will cause an error if you are trying to print an Lazy loaded object. 
To solve this we can use @Transitional, by using it the persistent context will remain opened the whole time. 
So when you try to read a Lazy loaded object the persistent context is already opened and the application will be able to pull the data when you need it.

When you try to return the object with it's entries from the service you need to use a DTO otherwise you get a lazy exception. 
because you returned the object with empty list because at the point when the persistent context was open you did'nt ask for the child.
